# Gyro-arduino

# This file will contain arduino program and schematic with PCB of my gyroscope trying.

# I  wrote the program in such a way that depending on how much you tilt the gyroscope from its standard position, the light of the given LED diode will be directly proportional to it.

# Pins 3 to 8 on arduino nano are outputs for the LGB leds, you can reconfigure the pinout as you want, i used the wiring for the gyroscope as i founded on the internet datasheet for the gyroscope (+ i downloaded library for it)

# My model of gyroscope is GY-521.

# Thank you.
