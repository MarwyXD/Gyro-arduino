# Gyro-arduino

# This file will contain arduino program and schematic with PCB of my gyroscope trying.

# I  wrote the program in such a way that depending on how much you tilt the gyroscope from its standard position, the light of the given LED diode will be directly proportional to it.

# Thank you.
